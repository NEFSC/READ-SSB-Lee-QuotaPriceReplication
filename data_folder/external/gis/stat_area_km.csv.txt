These are the statistical areas in the US that are in the US territorial waters

I did this by 
1. Editing the US maritime boundaries to be a "nice" polygon. I kept the outermost boundary (200nm) and hand-edited it so it was a nice polygon. 
2. Converted it to a polygon using a very small buffer in the XY.
3. Intersected that resulting polygon with the Statistical areas shape file
4. Added an extra field and used "calculate geometry" on it.  
5. Export the results to a csv, but keep only the ID and km^2 field.
