Semi-random DMIS documentation

# On Home Consumption Fish

> The code for this stuff is BHC_ (either _LIVE_POUNDS or _LANDED_POUNDS).  "BHC" stands for "Bait and Home Consumption".  A few years ago they added LUMF (Legal UnMarketable Fish) to this category as well.  LUMF, at lease for here, and at least as I understand it, is derived from observer trips only.  But I'm not 100% sure on that.

>If you use DLR_LIVE or DLR_LANDED (or DLR_DOLLAR) you won't get the BHC fish.  If you use LANDED or POUNDS or DOLLAR_SSB/GDP you'll get 'em, plus imputed values for the DOLLAR field.

>Starting on the next run of DMIS, fish that are authorized to be landed on EFP trips but are not sold thu a dealer will be added to the BHC_ fish.

# Versions

There is a "_current" versioning of tables. As of April 2020, current contains a little bit more data.  
> I now use _trip for everything, whereas a yearly ago I used _current.  There were some discrepancies for earlier years (2013?) that _trip had correct and _trip_current did not.  Otherwise I believe they are the same. (Chad)

>I have been using current since there is more recent data included. Hopefully for older data the two match up, but I haven't looked into that in a while. (Greg)
