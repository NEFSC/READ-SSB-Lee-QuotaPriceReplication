abstract = {Productivity change after transition to an individual transferable quota (ITQ) management system is driven by exit of some vessels, entry of other vessels, and changes in productivity of existing vessels. Generally, it is thought that an ITQ system boosts productivity due to the exit of less productive vessels. However, ITQ management systems also create an additional barrier to entry, and more productive vessels may not be able to enter the fishery. This study constructs the F{\"{a}}re-Primont index to measure productivity change for the Mid-Atlantic surf clam and ocean quahog fishery over a 32 year time period, which includes both pre and post-ITQ time periods. The index is then combined with a biomass change index to arrive at a measure of biomass adjusted productivity change. Results show that when biomass changes are considered, positive productivity gains occurred throughout the time period. Further examination of contributions from entering and survivor vessels show that entering vessels had little impact on aggregate productivity, but on an individual basis, they eventually were equal in productivity to survivor vessels.},

Fisheries management agencies often rely on inputs from user groups in planning, implementation and enforcement of regulatory systems. User involvement in fisheries management is a controversial subject in most of the countries represented here. Too much or too little involvement seem equally problematic. The issue is not so much if and why user groups should be involved, as how, which is basically a political question. User participation is a means through which users are empowered, and there is always a possibility that some will win while others will lose or be left out entirely. However, the question of how user groups should be incorporated in the management process is also a question of institutional design. In this respect, great diversity is demonstrated in our case studies. This suggests that the question of how users should be involved has many possible answers - none of them easy. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

The social planner's problem in this model is to maximize the discounted social benefit from consumption of a homogeneous resource under the constraint that cumulative consumption is no greater than the initial resource stock. The marginal resource rent for the optimal extraction path grows at the real rate of interest, and the equilibrium resource price meets this condition, known as “Hotelling's rule”. This rule modifies under the model extensions to heterogeneous resources: the marginal rent falls if extraction switches from low-cost to high-cost resource stocks. We consider the models of resource pricing in the presence of a backstop technology, the Herfindahl principle that a lower-cost resource stock depletes before extraction switches to a higher-cost stock, and the principle of comparative advantage for a more general case of heterogeneous resources and consumers.},

abstract = {Commercial fishing is a dangerous occupation despite decades of regulatory initiatives aimed at making it safer. We posit that rights-based fisheries management (the individual allocation of fishing quota to vessels or fishing entities, also called catch shares) can improve safety by solving many of the problems associated with the competitive race to fish experienced in fisheries around the world. The competitive nature of such fisheries results in risky behavior such as fishing in poor weather, overloading vessels with fishing gear, and neglecting maintenance. Although not necessarily intended to address safety issues, catch shares eliminate many of the economic incentives to fish as rapidly as possible. We develop a dataset and methods to empirically evaluate the effects of the adoption of catch shares management on a particularly risky type of behavior: the propensity to fish in stormy weather. After catch shares was implemented in an economically important US West Coast fishery, a fisherman's probability of taking a fishing trip in high wind conditions decreased by 82{\%} compared with only 31{\%} in the former race to fish fishery. Overall, catch shares caused the average annual rate of fishing on high wind days to decrease by 79{\%}. These results are evidence that institutional changes can significantly reduce individual, voluntary risk exposure and result in safer fisheries. catch shares | occupational safety | rights-based fisheries management | risk | sustainable fisheries},

abstract = {Since the publication of Rosen's " Hedonic Prices and Implicit Markets " , property value hedonics has become the workhorse model for valuing local public goods and amenities, despite a number of well-known and well-documented econometric problems. For example, Bartik (1987) and Epple (1987) each describe a source of endogeneity in the second stage of Rosen's two-step procedure that has proven difficult to overcome using standard econometric arguments. This problem has led researchers to avoid estimat-ing marginal willingness-to-pay functions altogether, relying instead on the first-stage hedonic price function, which can only be used to value marginal changes. In this pa-per, we propose a new econometric approach to recover the marginal willingness-to-pay function that avoids these endogeneity problems. With a parametric specification for the marginal willingness-to-pay function, our approach is both computationally light and easy to implement. We apply this estimator to data on large changes in violent crime rates in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas. Results indicate that marginal willingness to pay increases by between twenty to thirty cents with each additional case of violent crime per 100,000 residents, suggesting that simply using the first-stage hedonic price function to value non-marginal reductions in crime (like those that occurred during the 1990s) may lead to severely biased estimates of welfare.},

abstract = {Commercial fishers are constantly exposed to many risk factors, making it a dangerous occupation. Fisheries management that limits access and catches can give rise to well-known stock and rule-of-capture externalities known as the “race to fish.” This market failure dissipates rents and can lead fishers to take on additional risks such as fishing in poor weather, overloading vessels, or delaying maintenance to outcompete others. Rights-based management is expected to reduce the incentives to take on additional risk. Using a large dataset of fishers from around the United States, we empirically estimate the effects of individual fishing quota (IFQ) programs on one important risk factor: the decision to fish in poor weather. We find that risk-taking behavior generally decreases under IFQs, but the magnitude of the shift differs by fishery, and we explore potential drivers of these differences.},

We introduce an analytical model with firm heterogeneity to distinguish between traditional resource rent, which accrues to all owners, and inframarginal rent, which accrues to those with high skill. We show that, in the presence of skill heterogeneity, some current users (namely those with the highest skill) may prefer common-pool management, despite large aggregate increases in rents due to rationalization. Whether the transition to property rights is Pareto improving hinges critically on the initial allocation of rights, because inframarginal rents may be lower under property rights than limited entry. In our application to an important US fishery, property rights generate a ten-fold increase in market capitalization and a doubling in the present value of the resource, but without substantial free grandfathering, the top harvesters would rationally oppose the transition to property rights.},

Analysis of management actions affecting crew wages and well-being is often limited due to a dearth of available data. We examine crew-related outcomes during the first six years of the West Coast Groundfish Trawl Catch Share Program using two unique datasets–a mandatory economic survey and a voluntary social science study. We find that impacts on crew compensation differ from other catch share programs due to prior conditions of the fishery and also vary by the target species within the program. The median number of crew positions per vessel increased slightly, annual crew days decreased, and crew wage as a percentage of revenue was nearly unchanged, even with the introduction of new costs. Median daily crew compensation increased from {\$}514 per day to {\$}776 after implementation of catch shares and annual compensation increased from {\$}33 thousand to {\$}39 thousand. Many crew members expressed a lack of support for the program and job satisfaction did not rise with increased wages and fewer days at sea, indicating that job satisfaction is likely influenced by more than compensation and effort.},

abstract = {Can a perishable food commodity with strong seasonal variation in supply, supplied by producers with limited operational radius, belong to a spatially integrated market? The majority of Norwegian cod is landed during a few winter months. Moreover, most of the catch is landed fresh by a fleet consisting primarily of many smaller vessels with limited operational radius. This makes landing patterns and potentially markets regional. However, there are also landings in the remainder of the year, primarily by larger oceangoing vessels such as trawlers with a larger operational radius that may ensure market integration between the regions. Market integration can also be ensured through landings of a potential substitute; frozen cod, which is less perishable. In this paper we investigate the degree of market integration between different regions for fresh cod in Norway, and between fresh and frozen cod. We find that the markets for fresh cod are integrated but not all regions adhere to the Law of One Price. Markets for fresh and frozen cod are also integrated, but not to the extent that the Law of One Price holds. Finally, there is evidence of frozen cod leading the fresh cod prices.},

abstract = {In 2011 the National Marine Fisheries Service began a systematic collection of performance indicators for U.S. fisheries managed under catch shares. Catch shares are a fishery management tool that dedicate a secure share of quota allowing individual fishermen, fishing cooperatives, fishing communities, or other entities to harvest a fixed amount of fish. Catch share design varies widely across different programs and regions. Many programs share similar biological, social, and economic management objectives even though these design features are tailored to accommodate particular fishery characteristics. This paper evaluates fisheries using standardized indicators to measure the basic economic performance, regardless of catch share program design. Data collected were used to evaluate the economic and distribution effects of U.S. catch share programs. Catch share fishery performance is compared to a baseline period prior to implementation of the catch share program. Overall, the majority of objectives to improve the economic performance of catch share fisheries were achieved. Catch share programs have been effective in reducing fishing capacity. However, catch share programs have had distributional consequences as there are indications that consolidation is occurring in a number of programs. For example, there have been considerable reductions in the number of active vessels and entities holding quota share in the Alaska Halibut and Sablefish and the Mid-Atlantic Surfclam and Ocean Quahog catch share programs. However, it is important to note that the accumulation of ownership share may be less of a concern than consolidation in the use of quota. Thus, to the extent that consolidation is considered a management problem, it may be more effective to consider caps on the use of quota than by imposing more restrictive ownership caps.},

abstract = {Individual transferable quotas (ITQs) are one of the property rights instruments that have been employed to improve economic efficiency in fisheries. ITQs are not high-quality property rights in the basic fundamental marine resources on which fisheries are based. As a result ITQs cannot be expected to generate full efficiency in the use of these resources. This article examines to what extent ITQs are capable of generating economic efficiency in fisheries. It is shown that ITQs can greatly improve efficiency in fishing. Moreover, by including recreational fishers in the system, ITQs can strike an efficient balance between commercial and recreational fishing. On the negative side, it is shown that on their own, ITQs are not capable of generating full efficiency in fisheries. In particular, ITQs are not sufficient for setting the socially optimal total allowable catch, ensuring the optimal use of the ecosystem, or harmonizing fishing with conflicting uses of marine resources such as marine tourism, mining, and conservation. Potentially counteracting these limitations, ITQ holders as a group have an incentive to manage overall ecosystem use for the long-term benefit of their fishery and negotiate the adjustment of their fishing activity toward the interests of conflicting uses of the marine resources.(JEL: Q2, Q22, Q26, Q3). {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

The optimal utilization of quotas is thus dependent on development of an efficient quota market, but markets in multispecies IFQ fisheries develop slowly and may fail to perform efficiently even after several years. In 2011 an IFQ system was implemented for the Pacific groundfish trawl fishery in the US. After four years, the quota market does not appear to be yielding effi-cient prices for many species or distributing quota efficiently. I explore the structure and performance of the QP market and discuss the impediments to market efficiency. Drawing from theory and experience in other multi-species IFQ systems, I discuss other quota distribution and catch-balancing mechanisms that can supplement and perhaps improve inefficient markets and enable higher quota utilization rates.},

In many parts of the world, the development of well crafted markets for multispecies or multiregional fisheries is still evolving. As a result, there exists an opportunity to inform policy by providing research insights into the relative merits of alternative market designs for such fisheries. This study explored the relative merits of a simultaneous ascending auction design and an iterative combinatorial auction design for a hypothetical multiple region quota market. In a simultaneous auction, separate auctions are run in parallel for individual species or regions. During intermediate rounds, fishers can adjust their bids in auction depending on their position in the other auction. In a combinatorial auction, a fisher can purchase a combination of quotas (or a package quota) for different fish species or regions in the same auction. Being able to acquire bundles of species or regions allows fishers to take advantage of complementarities. To date, the potentials of such auctions have not been thoroughly tested in fisheries quota markets. This study found that while a simultaneous auction design was more efficient than combinatorial auction design overall, combinatorial market design took fewer rounds to make final allocations and performed better in high synergy environments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A growing number of US fisheries are managed with catch share programs, which allocate exclusive shares of the total allowable catch from a fish stock to individuals, cooperatives, communities, or other entities. All of these catch share programs allow transferability of catch privileges in some form. Information on these transfers, particularly prices, could be valuable to fishery managers and to fishery participants to support management and business decisions and to increase efficiency of the catch share market itself. This article documents the availability and quality of data on transfers of catch privileges in fourteen US catch share programs. These catch share programs include several individual fishing quota (IFQ) programs and a number of programs that allocate catch privileges to self-organized cooperatives. Price information on catch share transfers is found to be limited or unavailable in most US catch share programs. Recommendations are made on how to improve the design of catch share programs and associated data collection systems to facilitate effective catch share markets, collection of catch share market data, and better use of information from catch share markets.},

abstract = {Fisheries managers have increasingly adopted rights-based management (i.e., “catch shares” or “individual transferable quotas” [ITQs]) to address economic and biological management challenges under prior governance regimes. Despite their ability to resolve some of the symptoms of the tragedy of the commons and improve economic efficiency, catch shares remain controversial for their potentially disruptive social effects. One criticism is that the benefits of rights-based reforms are unequally distributed across vessels and between fishery participants (e.g., crew and hired captains) and that stakeholders that do not receive an allocation of harvest rights may see their remuneration decrease. Yet, empirically assessing these claims is difficult in almost all ITQs due to poor availability of longitudinal cost, earnings, and employment data. This paper evaluates these claims using vessel-level data to characterize impacts of a long-established ITQ program for Alaskan crab fisheries on the level and distribution of payments to claimant groups. We find that the share of vessel proceeds accruing to captains, crew, and vessel owners declined under the catch-share regime to make room for new payments to quota owners. Average daily payments to captains, crew, and vessel owners declined, albeit slightly, yet retained their pre-ITQ premia relative to compensation in other sectors. However, inequality in payments to workers and vessel owners declined after ITQs, as did the interseasonal volatility in compensation to workers, a measure of financial risk. Finally, we find that consolidation-induced increases in leasing costs have had little effect on workers' remuneration, but have reduced returns to vessel ownership.},

The number of individuals employed declined proportionately to the exit of vessels following implementation. Total crew hours dedicated to fishing activities remained roughly constant, while employment in redundant pre- and post-season activities declined due to the consolidation of quota on fewer vessels. We find little evidence of substantial changes in the share contracts used to compensate fishermen. Finally, we explore a wide array of remuneration measures for crew and conclude that both seasonal and daily employment remuneration increased substantially for many crew in the postrationalization fishery, while remuneration per unit of landings declined as a result of a combination of increased crew productivity and the necessity of paying for fishing quota in the new system.

abstract = {Fishers face multidimensional decisions: when to fish, what species to target, and how much gear to deploy. Most bioeconomic models assume single-species fisheries with perfectly elastic demand and focus on inter-seasonal dynamics. In real-world fisheries, vessels hold quotas for multiple species with heterogeneous biological and/or market conditions that vary intra-seasonally. We analyze within-season behavior in multispecies fisheries with individual fishing quotas, accounting for stock aggregations, capacity constraints, and downward-sloping demand. Numerical results demonstrate variation in harvest patterns. We specifically find: (1) harvests for species with downward-sloping demand tend to spread out; (2) spreading harvest of a high-value species can cause lower-value species to be harvested earlier in the season; and (3) harvest can be unresponsive or even respond negatively to biological aggregation when fishers balance incentives in multispecies settings. We test these using panel data from the Norwegian multispecies groundfish fishery and find evidence for all three. We extend the numerical model to account for transitions to management with individual fishing quotas in multispecies fisheries. We show that, under some circumstances, fishing seasons could contract or spread out.},

Despite the number of species covered, when TACs were increased for some species and reduced for others, fishers were able to adjust the species mixture in their catches. The top 34 vessels frequented a wide range (mean 38, range 20-69) of "fishing opportunities" (repeated trawls along the same track line) containing predictable species mixtures. When TACs for rougheye (Sebastes aleutianus), shortraker (Sebastes borealis), and yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) were sharply cut, fishers avoided fishing opportunities where these species were more abundant. More generally, their choice of fishing opportunities depended on the expected multispecies composition, although other factors were probably also important. {\textcopyright} 2008 NRC.},

Most assessments are on developed world fisheries. Using a unique collection of datasets, we develop counterfactuals to evaluate the economic impacts of the Chilean jack mackerel catch share program. We investigate vessel and trip characteristics, as well as trip costs and revenues, before and after the implementation of the program. We find an increase in higher value products and associated revenue, as well as consolidation of catch on larger vessels, vessels taking longer trips, and those catching more per trip. Overall, we estimate that the program led to a measureable increase in fishing profits, mainly due to movement toward higher-value products. A back-of-the-envelope calculation results in an implied annual quota rental rate on the order of approximately 15-19{\%}of ex-vessel prices.},

The universal policy response to this failure seems to consist of nothing more imaginative than the free gifting to the commercial fishing sector of permanent endowments of income and wealth under the utopian claims associated with individual transferable quotas (iTQs). it now seems that the fishing industry is to be entrusted to become exemplary stewards, to become efficient, to maximize resource rent, to stop racing for fish, and to make society better off. These exultant promises are rendered false by the incoherent models from fisheries economics that are confused about the essential concepts of: 1. efficiency 2. economic rent 3. resource rent 4. ricardian rent 5. average costs and average revenue among firms and across an industry 6. extra-normal profits 7. stewardship 8.

Using individual vessel data prior to and after the introduction of ITQs in Canada's multi-species Scotia-Fundy mobile gear fishery, the paper uses an index number profit decomposition to compare vessel performance over time and across individual vessels. The approach allows us to undertake both an ex post evaluation of short-term impacts of ITQs and an ex ante evaluation of longer term impacts. With respect to short-term impacts, the results suggest that larger vessels have benefited the most from the introduction of ITQs, but that all vessels have enjoyed increases in the prices received for those fish species that are included in the quota program. With respect to longer-term impacts, the transferability provisions of the ITQ program have encouraged exit and more efficient operations to prevail. {\textcopyright} Agricultural Economics Society.},

" The staggered introductions of catch shares in the Alaska pollock and Pacific hake fisheries—neighboring regional fisheries that are the largest and sixth largest fishery by volume in the United States, respectively—provide a unique natural experiment for isolating the impact of " catch shares. " Difference-in-difference-in-differences estimations, combined with vessel fixed effects, indicate that catch shares are associated with an increase in the number of days that a harvester spends at sea engaging in fishing activities, which implies a slowing of fishing effort, ceteris paribus. For the Pacific hake fishery, participation in the pollock fishery is a negative predictor of a harvester's days at sea in the target fishery. In the initial two years when the hake fishery was rationalized before the pollock fishery the pollock fishery served as a derby alternative for hake harvesters. Results also show that pollock and hake harvesters re-spond to changing economic conditions: fish or fish product prices are positive predic-tors of days at sea. For the Pacific hake catcher-processor fleet, an estimated increase in days at sea per ton of catch suggests that a harvester's fishing intensity has also slowed as a result of catch shares.},

First, we estimate the determinants of improved chickpea adoption using a double hurdle model. We apply a control function approach with correlated random effects to control for possible endogeneity resulting from access to improved seed and technology transfer activities. To instrument for these variables we develop novel distance weighted measures of a household's neighbours' access to improved seed and technology transfer activities. Second, we estimate the impact of area under improved chickpea cultivation on household income and poverty. We apply a fixed effects instrumental variables approach where we use the predicted area under cultivation from the double hurdle model as an instrument for observed area under cultivation. We find that improved chickpea adoption significantly increases household income while also reducing household poverty. Finally, we disaggregate results by landholding to explore whether the impact of adoption has heterogeneous effects. Adoption favoured all but the largest landholders, for who the new technology did not have a significant impact on income. Overall, increasing access to improved chickpea appears a promising pathway for rural development in Ethiopia's chickpea growing regions.},

Here, the assumption that an ITQ-regime will lead to an immediate reduction of catch capacity and discourage investment in the fisheries seems questionable, as the ITQ-regime seems to represent an input of "new" capital into the fisheries. As a result of quota leasing arrangements, tenancy relations have developed between parts of the coastal fleet and companies with large quota holdings. Crew wages have in these cases dropped, a situation that has provoked two strikes among fishermen. The demand for quotas is influenced by unemployment and lack of alternative sources of income for fishermen. Municipalities are in a number of cases significant participants in the quota market, as there are strong ties between companies and municipalities. A redistribution of wealth and income is taking place as a result of the system. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

We hypothesize that the success and longevity of these sectors is likely to depend, in part, on the relationships amongst the members including their degree of trust and ability to collaborate. The value of these relationships and the ability to cooperate is commonly referred to as social capital. Prior to the implemen-tation of the new sector system, we conducted a survey to derive baseline measures of social capital for individual groundfish permit holders and sectors. We construct indi-ces of bonding, bridging and linking social capital, information sharing, and trust. We explore correlations between these social capital indices, characteristic of the vessels in the sectors, and various measures of economic performance of sectors.},

abstract = {A B S T R A C T In 2010 a new management system based on harvest cooperatives called " sectors " was implemented in the US Northeast Multispecies Groundfish Fishery. We hypothesize that success of individual sectors might depend on their social capital. Sector members were surveyed prior to the implementation of the policy to develop baseline measures of social capital for each sector and again after the sectors had been operating for three years. We construct indices of bonding, bridging and linking social capital, information sharing, and trust and explore how these indicators of social capital have changed since the implementation of the sector program. We also evaluate the relationship between these social capital indicators and various measures of economic performance of sectors. The result suggests that the relationship between social capital and economic performance has strengthened over time. Profitability is associated with broader community and fishery-wide connections as well as bonding social capital within sectors.},

This review surveys a wide range of empirical experiences in different contexts around the world to help provide a fuller picture of potential and sometimes disparate consequences from privatization in general and new ways of organizing around fishing that can follow in the wake of such measures. Looking at the many different participants in the fishing industry-from crew, small-boat owners, to households and communities-as well as the diverse sociocultural contexts in which fishing takes place, enables a better understanding of who and what is impacted, how they are impacted, why and with what further consequences, such that communities come to be seen less oppositional to economy, but rather constituted by multiple scalar processes and by economic relations comprising different motivations and behaviors. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

@article{Brodziak2008,
abstract = {Rebuilding depleted fishery resources is a worldwide problem. In the U.S., the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act (MSRA) of 2007 requires that "Conservation and management measures shall prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery...". However, translating this legal mandate into tangible goals and actions presents several technical challenges, especially for resources that have been chronically over-exploited. For example, maximum sustainable yields and biomass reference points are poorly estimated for stocks that have been overfished for a long period of time and are poorly defined unless sufficient data are available from periods of low-fishing mortality rates and relatively high-stock sizes. The conundrum of how to set meaningful rebuilding goals given limited information on the population dynamics and trophic interactions of a rebuilt stock can generally be addressed through adaptive management procedures incorporating learning about density-dependent population dynamics. Monitoring changes in life history parameters and recruitment is critical for successful rebuilding strategies realizing the full yield potential of rebuilt stocks while periodic re-evaluation of rebuilding targets is also needed to address uncertainties due to density dependence, trophic interactions or environmental factors. This paper summarizes the development and implementation of goals and strategies to rebuild New England groundfish stocks over the past decade. Management is particularly challenging because the true yield and population size potentials of these interacting stocks is unknown due to chronic overfishing throughout the modern history of the fishery, uncertainty in compensatory/depensatory population dynamics and in the degree of stationarity in environmental control of groundfish recruitment.},

@techreport{Palmer2017,
abstract = {Amendment 16 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan was implemented in May 2010 and brought about many changes in the management of the Northeast United States groundfish fishery. Among the changes was a shift from an input control system (days-at-sea, trip limits, etc.) to a quota based catch-share system with each vessel and harvest cooperative accountable for its total catch (landings and discards). This quota-based system could have created incentives to intentionally misreport catch along these lines, particularly for stocks where quota was limited. This possibility of incentives would be particularly true for allocated groundfish species managed as multiple stocks (Atlantic cod [Gadus morhua], haddock [Melanogrammus aeglefinus], yellowtail flounder [Limanda ferruginea], and winter flounder [Pseudopleuronectes americanus]).For these four stocks, catches of lower quota stocks of the same species could be reported in another stock area where quota was less limiting by either inaccurately reporting the fishing area or catch location on the vessel trip report (VTR). Accurate reporting is critical to ensuring that fishery removals are managed appropriately and that fish stocks are not overharvested. Vessel monitoring system (VMS) positional data were used to validate the statistical area fished and stock apportionment of allocated groundfish landings derived from mandatory VTRs for the period January 1, 2007 to April 30, 2016 (covers fishing years 2008 to 2015) to examine whether changes in reporting patterns occurred after the transition to the catch-share system. Additionally, the relative amount of stock-level catch reporting errors was estimated from the differences between the VMS-based method and reported VTR landings. While the VMS methods can be imprecise, they are useful for detecting shifts in reporting patterns over time and estimating the general scale of the errors. Results show the difference in VMS estimated catch and VTR reported catch changing markedly beginning in fishing year 2010 for several of the quota-limited stocks. These discrepancies occurred despite marginal improvements in compliance with VTR area fished reporting requirements over the same time period. For the majority of the stocks examined, the overall error is estimated to be small and may not substantially impact resource monitoring and stock assessment efforts; however for some stocks the estimated errors are large in one or more years (Eastern Georges Bank and Gulf of Maine cod, Gulf of Maine haddock, Southern New England/Mid-Atlantic winter flounder). While the impacts on some stocks may be large, the magnitude in terms of number of vessels contributing to the overall error is small. Much of the error could be mitigated through improvements in catch monitoring and/or management measures designed to improve catch accounting.},
