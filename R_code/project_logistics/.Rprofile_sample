# .Rprofile -- commands to execute at the beginning of each R session

# To use this, delete _sample and put this in a place that R searches for a .Renviron file.
# Don't delete the leading period   

# Min-Yang puts this in his home directory (/home2/mlee) on the network AND in his home directory on his laptop ("/Documents/")
# You can use this file to load packages, set options, etc.

# NOTE: changes in this file won't be reflected until after you quit
# and start a new session

# Load the NEFSC network into a variable
network_location_desktop = "<the_ipaddress_to_the_network>"
# This might work better 
network_location_desktop = "blah.blah..noaa.gov"

# You might want to set your GITHUB PAT here, but only if other methods are not working
# Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "YOUR PAT HERE")

# If you lose the ability to intall packages on the network and get an error that looks like:
# Error: ERROR: no permission to install to directory ‘/opt/R/4.0.5/lib/R/library’
# Then you can set the install library here.  However, this may cause problems when there are different versions of R installed on the different servers, so tread carefully.
# Sys.setenv(R_LIBS_USER = "//net/path/to/your/home/R/x86_64_pc-linux-gnu-library")
